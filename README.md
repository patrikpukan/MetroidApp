# Prague Metro & Tram Timetables - Android Application

##  Prague Public Transport Companion

## Overview

This project is an Android application designed to provide users in Prague with easy access to metro and tram timetables. The app aims to offer a modern, user-friendly experience leveraging the latest Android development tools and design principles, including Jetpack Compose and Material You.

The core functionality will revolve around displaying accurate and up-to-date public transport schedules to help users navigate Prague efficiently.

## Planned Features

* **Timetable Access:**
    * Browse and search for Metro line schedules.
    * Browse and search for Tram line schedules.
    * View departure and arrival times for specific stations.
    * Real-time updates (if accessible via a public API).
* **User Interface & Experience:**
    * Modern Material You design.
    * Intuitive bottom navigation with three main sections:
        1.  **Timetables/Search:** Main section for looking up lines and station schedules.
        2.  **(To Be Defined Section 2):** e.g., Map View, Route Planner, or Nearby Stops.
        3.  **(To Be Defined Section 3):** e.g., Favorites, Service Alerts, or Settings.
    * Light and Dark theme support.
* **Offline Access:**
    * Ability to cache timetable data for offline use (where feasible).
* **Favorites:**
    * Allow users to save frequently used lines or stations for quick access.
* **(Potentially) Service Alerts:**
    * Display information about disruptions or changes in service, if available.

## Technology Stack

* **Programming Language:** Kotlin
* **UI Toolkit:** Jetpack Compose (for declarative UI development)
* **Architecture:** MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel) or similar modern Android architecture pattern.
* **Asynchronous Programming:** Kotlin Coroutines & Flow
* **Dependency Injection:** Hilt (recommended)
* **Networking:** Retrofit / Ktor (for API communication if a public API is used)
* **Local Storage:** Room Persistence Library (for caching data, favorites)
* **Navigation:** Jetpack Navigation Component (for Compose)
* **Design Language:** Material You (Material Design 3)
* **Build Tool:** Gradle

## Project Structure

The project aims to follow a feature-based modularization approach for better organization and scalability. Key directories will include:

* `core/`: Shared components like navigation, theming, utilities.
* `data/`: Data sources (local and remote), repositories, domain models.
* `di/`: Dependency injection modules.
* `ui/`: Feature-specific UI screens (Composables) and ViewModels.
    * `feature_timetables/`
    * `feature_section2/` (placeholder for the second navigation item)
    * `feature_section3/` (placeholder for the third navigation item)

(A more detailed file structure was previously outlined and should be referred to for specifics.)

## Setup & Build

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone <repository-url>
    ```
2.  **Open in Android Studio:**
    * Ensure you have the latest stable version of Android Studio.
    * Select "Open an Existing Project" and navigate to the cloned directory.
3.  **Build the project:**
    * Android Studio should automatically sync Gradle files.
    * Click "Build" > "Make Project" or run the app on an emulator/device.

## Future Enhancements (To-Do)

* Integration with a live Prague Public Transport API (e.g., PID Lítačka, Golemio, or other available sources).
* Map integration to visualize routes and station locations.
* Route planning capabilities.
* Real-time vehicle tracking (if API supports).
* Widget support for quick timetable access.
* Accessibility improvements.
* Localization for Czech and other languages.
